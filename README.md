# Whack-a-Mole from Verilog
An FPGA version of Whack-a-Mole! Without a computer, users can plug in their DE1-SoC Intel FPGAs to their monitors and play an amazing game of Whack-a-Mole! Users can move hit Moles with the four button keys on the FPGA. The user can collected points for every Mole hit and loses a point for every mole missed. But the user needs to be careful; the game will be lost when he hits a special Bomb Mole! This project was made as a final course project for CSC 258: Computer Organization.
